node-red-contrib-ftp
========================
A Node-RED node to FTP Server.

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/node-red-contrib-ftp.png?downloads=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/node-red-contrib-ftp/)

Install
-------

Run the following command in the root directory of your Node-RED install

    npm install node-red-contrib-ftp

Usage
-------

This node will allow you to LIST, GET, PUT and DELETE files on a remote FTP server. The GET and PUT options use msg.filename (the path/name of the file on the remote machine) and msg.localFilename (the path/name of the file on the local machine - i.e. the one running NR).

The DELETE option only specifies msg.filename (the path/name of the file on the remote machine)
The LIST option returns an array of the file/folders in the user's default ftp folder, containing
type, name, sticky, rights(an object), acl, owner, group, size and date.
